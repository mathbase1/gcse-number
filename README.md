# GCSE Number Quiz (Public Repo)

This repository is a public wrapper/redirect.

✅ The live quiz runs on Netlify, where the question generation + marking logic is kept server-side (Netlify Functions).

## What to do
1. Deploy the private Netlify project (from the other ZIP) to Netlify.
2. Copy your Netlify URL (for example: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/`).
3. Edit `index.html` in this repo and replace:
   - `__PASTE_YOUR_NETLIFY_URL_HERE__`
   with your real Netlify URL.

(That’s the only edit in the public repo.)
